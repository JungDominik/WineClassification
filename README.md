# WineClassification

### Comparison of different classification methods on a dataset of wines.

### Description

Sample project using a dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

The analysis is performed using the scikit-learn package in Python. For user readability, a Jupyter Notebook is provided which guides the user through the steps of the analysis. The notebook is available in two forms
- Interactive environment ("Binder", recommended): [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JungDominik/WineClassification/main?labpath=%2Fwine_jupyterNB.ipynb)
  - Alternative link: [Click Here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JungDominik/WineClassification/main?labpath=%2Fwine_jupyterNB.ipynb)
- Static Jupyter Notebook here on Github  

The dataset has the following specifics
- 3 Different Wine Types as classification variable
- 13 attributes are provided (Chemical analysis of the wines)
- The dataset can be obtained from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine


The following Classification Methods are compared
